# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

**Overview of anlaysis:**
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is a bias towards reviews that were written by the Vine program. I chose to analyze the reviews of Video DVDs and used PySpark to select, filter and calculate the percentages of five star reviews. 

**Results**

**o	How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

**Summary:**
According to the data there is no positivity bias. The paid percentage is just over 18%, where the unpaid percentage is 51.6%. This demonstrates that the majority of 5 star reviews (in total, and based on percentages) came from unpaid reviews. An additional analysis that I would like to do is to analyze 1 star reviews. I would be interested in getting the totals and percentages of 1 star reviews and compare this to our 5 star. Iâ€™m curious as to if the paid reviews have a negative bias.
